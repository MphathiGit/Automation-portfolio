# Automation-portfolio
Web Automation project using Selenium, Java,TestNg and Maven Technologies
This is a little project to display selenium with Java capabilities. It consists of a Test to go to a travel website, enter a Destination, then enter your own 
travel dates(dynamic handling of date picker/calendar) and the price range for the Hotel you would like to book. The script then scrolls down the search results
page with returned hotel search results, until it finds one that matches your entered price range and scrolls down util it finds it, then selects this hotel to view availability.

The test framework used in TestNg, back end programming is done in Java with the help of WebDrivers.

The above mentioned test is in the Automation-portfolio-main\src\test\java\ui folder , the class name is TestFindHotel.Java,  all the other classes are implementing OOP principles and wrapping up the code in relevant places instead of having all the code in one file.
